Creative Commons Corporation (“Creative Commons”) is not a law firm and does not provide legal services or legal advice.
Distribution of Creative Commons public licenses does not create a lawyer-client or other relationship.
Creative Commons makes its licenses and related information available on an “as-is” basis.
Creative Commons gives no warranties regarding its licenses, any material licensed under their terms and conditions, or any related information.
Creative Commons disclaims all liability for damages resulting from their use to the fullest extent possible.

Using Creative Commons Public Licenses
    Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and conditions that creators and other rights holders may use
    to share original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright and certain other rights specified in the public license below.
    The following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.

    Considerations for licensors:
        Our public licenses are intended for use by those authorized to give the public permission to use material
        in ways otherwise restricted by copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable.
        Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
        Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material as expected.
        Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-licensed material,
        or material used under an exception or limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors.

    Considerations for the public:
        By using one of our public licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the licensed material under specified terms and conditions.
        If the licensor’s permission is not necessary for any reason–for example, because of any applicable exception or limitation
        to copyright–then that use is not regulated by the license.
        Our licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has authority to grant.
        Use of the licensed material may still be restricted for other reasons, including because others have copyright or other rights in the material.
        A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that all changes be marked or described. Although not required by our licenses,
        you are encouraged to respect those requests where reasonable. More considerations for the public.
